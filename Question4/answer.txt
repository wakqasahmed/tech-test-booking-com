Code Explanation: 
1) It's an anonymous function
2) It's written using OOP design pattern
3) It has a private property called 'name' that can only be accessed or modified through its exposed functions
4) The function self invokes/runs after it is interprated (without need of calling App(); )

Why: 
1) OOP pattern for reusibility of the code
2) To save from spaghetti code
3) For better readibility (human readable)
4) Self describing code
5) Modularity
